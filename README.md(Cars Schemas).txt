🚗 SQL Cars Database Project📌 Project OverviewThis project demonstrates a relational database design for managing car dealership data. It includes schemas, sample data, and queries for:Cars 🚘 (Brand, Model, Year, Fuel Type, Price)Customers 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 (Customer info & purchases)Sales 💰 (Tracking transactions)Dealers 🏢 (Car dealership network)The database schema is written in MySQL, but it can easily be adapted to other RDBMS.---🛠️ Features✔️ Database creation scripts✔️ Table relationships (Primary Key, Foreign Key)✔️ Sample data insertion✔️ Example queries (JOINs, Aggregations, Filtering)✔️ Ready-to-use for learning or interview preparation---📂 Project Structure```bash📁 SQL-Cars-Database ┣ 📜 Cars Schemas.sql   # Main schema & insert queries ┣ 📜 Queries.sql        # Sample queries (joins, aggregations, etc.) ┣ 📜 README.md          # Project documentation```---🗄️ Database SchemaEntity-Relationship (ER) Diagram(You can add an image of your ERD here for better visualization)---📝 Example Queries🔹 1. Get all cars with price above 5,00,000:```sqlSELECT * FROM CarsWHERE Price > 500000;```🔹 2. Find sales with customer & dealer info (JOIN):```sqlSELECT c.Name AS Customer, d.Name AS Dealer, s.SaleDate, ca.Brand, ca.ModelFROM Sales sJOIN Customers c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerIDJOIN Dealers d ON s.DealerID = d.DealerIDJOIN Cars ca ON s.CarID = ca.CarID;```🔹 3. Total sales per dealer:```sqlSELECT d.Name AS Dealer, COUNT(*) AS TotalSalesFROM Sales sJOIN Dealers d ON s.DealerID = d.DealerIDGROUP BY d.Name;```---🚀 How to RunClone this repository:```bash   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-cars-database.git   ```Import `Cars Schemas.sql` into MySQL / Workbench.Run queries from `Queries.sql` for practice.---🎯 Learning GoalsStrengthen SQL skills (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations)Practice Database normalization & designPrepare for SQL interviews---📌 Author👤 [Your Name]🔗 LinkedIn | GitHub---Would you like me to also create a matching ER diagram image (Cars–Customers–Sales–Dealers) so you can embed it in your README for extra visual appeal?
